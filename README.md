# Introduction

This project's objective is to successfully combine VUE.js and DHTMLX.js in order to:
1. have component-based file structure
2. have routes, so when pressing F5 it stays on the same place in the app, and also have different entry points and ability to share urls within the app
3. use the reactiveness of VUE to improve performance
